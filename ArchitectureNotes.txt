Designing a simple Point of Sale (POS) system using Golang, React.js, and PostgreSQL involves several components, and you can follow a combination of design patterns to build a maintainable and scalable application. Here's a suggested architecture and design pattern:

**1. Model-View-Controller (MVC) Pattern:**
   - **Model:** In Golang, create a package for handling data models and database interactions. This package will define the structure of your data (e.g., Product, Sale, User) and handle CRUD operations.

   - **View:** In React.js, components should handle the user interface and presentation logic. Use state management (e.g., Redux) to manage the client-side application state.

   - **Controller:** Implement controllers in Golang to handle incoming HTTP requests, process data, and interact with the Model. Use a router like Gorilla Mux to manage routes.

**2. Repository Pattern:**
   - Create a repository layer in Golang to abstract away the database operations. This allows you to switch to a different database system without affecting the rest of your application.

**3. Service Layer:**
   - Implement a service layer in Golang to encapsulate the business logic of your POS system. This layer can interact with the repository and apply business rules such as calculating totals, managing inventory, etc.

**4. Authentication and Authorization:**
   - Implement user authentication and authorization using JWT (JSON Web Tokens) or OAuth 2.0. Ensure that only authorized users can access certain parts of the system.

**5. Database Design:**
   - Design the PostgreSQL database schema carefully, taking into account tables for products, sales, users, and any other relevant entities. Use foreign keys for relationships.

**6. React.js Components:**
   - Create reusable React components for common UI elements like product lists, shopping carts, and user management.

**7. API Endpoints:**
   - Design a RESTful API with appropriate endpoints for actions like creating a sale, adding/removing products from a sale, managing user accounts, etc.

**8. State Management in React:**
   - Use a state management library like Redux to manage the global state of your React application. This will help you manage shopping cart state and user authentication, among other things.

**9. Real-time Updates (Optional):**
   - If real-time updates are necessary, consider integrating WebSockets using libraries like Socket.IO to provide features like live inventory updates and order status notifications.

**10. Error Handling and Logging:**
    - Implement robust error handling throughout your application and use a logging system to track errors and application events.

**11. Testing:**
    - Write unit tests and integration tests for both the Golang and React.js components of your application to ensure its stability and reliability.

**12. Deployment:**
    - Deploy your Golang API and React.js frontend separately. Consider containerization with Docker and container orchestration with Kubernetes for scalability.

**13. Documentation:**
    - Create comprehensive documentation for your codebase, API endpoints, and data models to help with maintenance and future development.

Remember that this is a simplified overview, and the complexity of your POS system may require additional design considerations. Adapt the design patterns and architecture to the specific needs of your application, and continuously refactor and optimize as your project evolves.
